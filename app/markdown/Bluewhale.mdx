## Anatomy of a Blue Whale

1. Size

Blue whales are colossal. In fact, they are not just the largest animal today but the largest animal to have ever lived, even larger than the biggest dinosaurs.

>	Fun Fact: A blue whaleâ€™s tongue alone can weigh as much as an elephant, and its heart as much as an automobile.

2. Color

Despite their name, blue whales arenâ€™t truly blue. They have a bluish-grey color when seen underwater but can appear more mottled grey when surfaced. Their blue hue is most noticeable when observed beneath the water where the light enhances their natural coloring.

3. Blowholes

Blue whales have two blowholes, which they use for breathing. When they surface, they exhale with a powerful blow that can reach up to 30 feet into the air!

Feeding Habits

Blue whales are filter feeders. Instead of hunting large prey, they consume tiny creatures such as krill using their baleen plates.

4. Baleen Plates

Blue whales have baleen instead of teeth. These fibrous plates help them filter out food from the water. When feeding, they open their enormous mouths, taking in large volumes of water and krill, then push the water out through the baleen, trapping the krill inside.
