## **The Incredible Journey of a Salmon: From Birth to Spawning**

### Introduction
The journey of a salmon, from birth to its eventual return for spawning, is an *extraordinary* adventure through **rivers, lakes, and oceans**. This journey, known as **anadromous migration**, involves leaving freshwater as juveniles, growing and maturing in the vast ocean, and ultimately returning to their birthplace to **spawn**.

### 1. **Birth: The Beginning in Freshwater**
Salmon are born in *freshwater* rivers and streams. The **eggs**, deposited in gravel nests called *redds*, hatch into **alevins**, the first stage of a salmon's life.

- **Alevins** carry a yolk sac that provides nutrition.
- After absorbing the yolk sac, they become **fry**, which emerge from the gravel and start feeding in the stream.

> "The journey begins in the safety of the stream, but the perils of the ocean await."

### 2. **Smoltification: Preparing for the Ocean**
As salmon grow, they undergo a process called **smoltification**, transforming into **smolts**:

- **Silver scales** develop, helping them blend in with the ocean's blue waters.
- They *adapt physiologically* to survive in **saltwater**.

At this stage, salmon begin their **downstream migration** toward the ocean.

### 3. **The Ocean Odyssey: Maturation in the Sea**
Once in the ocean, salmon spend **several years** maturing. They travel thousands of kilometers, feeding on fish, squid, and other marine life, all while facing predators and other dangers.

- **Diet**: Primarily small fish and crustaceans.
- **Growth**: Salmon grow rapidly in the nutrient-rich ocean environment.

> Salmon can grow from a small smolt to a 20 kg adult in just a few years!
